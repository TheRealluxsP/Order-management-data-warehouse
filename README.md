This project is a simple order management data warehouse, developed as part of the Databases and Data Warehouses course at LETI - ISEP.

It was created in a team of three with the goal of learning how to build a data warehouse using codeless tools, specifically SSIS in Visual Studio.

ðŸ’¡ Note: The project was initially hosted on a university account. After completion, it was migrated to this personal repository â€” hence the single commit history.
